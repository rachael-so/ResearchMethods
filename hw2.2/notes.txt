Table Notes
The table includes two regression analyses: the parallel trends test (first column) and the Difference-in-Differences (DnD) regression (second column). The parallel trends test examines if trends in lung hospitalizations were parallel between states that eventually implemented a vaping ban and those that did not before 2021. The DnD regression estimates the impact of the vaping ban on lung hospitalizations.

Controls: Both regressions have state and year fixed effects to control for state-specific characteristics and yearly trends.

Interpretation: The parallel trends test shows a significant coefficient for pre_treatment_trend, suggesting some non-parallel trends between the two groups of states before the ban. In the DnD regression, the post_treatment_effect coefficient is significant and negative, indicating a reduction in lung hospitalizations in states with the vaping ban compared to those without.

Figure Notes
The figure displays average lung hospitalizations over time for states with (red line) and without (blue line) a vaping ban. Trends are visually parallel before 2021. After 2021, a noticeable decrease in lung hospitalizations occurs in states with the ban.

Finding: The vaping ban is associated with a significant reduction in lung hospitalizations in states that implemented it, but there remains mixed evidence on the parallel trends assumption.
